Toggl Dashboard
===============

Time tracking is one of the resources in my toolset to manage my life and work. I have been a [Toggl](https://toggl.com/) user for many years now because the official applications has excellent UX and nice features to analyze the tracked activities. Nevertheless, I needed further analysis of my time tracking patterns.

I've built this [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) application with R to cover some of these personal requirements. Right now it uses a dataset exported from Toggl's Detailed Reports (part of the content has been changed to anonymize the data), but API integration is one of the goals for future versions.

This application is published on shinyapps.io: https://floresf.shinyapps.io/toggl-dashboard/
