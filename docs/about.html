<h3>About</h3>

<p>Time tracking is one of the resources in my toolset to manage my life and work. I have been a <a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a> user for many years now because the official applications has excellent UX and nice features to analyze the tracked activities. Nevertheless, I needed further analysis of my time tracking patterns.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve built this <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/">shinydashboard</a> application with R to cover some of these personal requirements. Right now it uses a dataset exported from Toggl&#39;s Detailed Reports (part of the content has been changed to anonymize the data), but API integration is one of the goals for future versions.</p>

<p>If you would like to contact me, check out the details on my <a href="https://floresfdev.github.io">website</a>.</p>
